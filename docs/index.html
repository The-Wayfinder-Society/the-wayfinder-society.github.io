    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      The Musical Wayfinder is an interactive visualization intended to bridge that gap between us and our music. This tool allows you to track your musical tastes through time, investigate the musical attributes of > 3,000 genres catalogued by Spotify, and discover where your personal library falls within that vast musical landscape. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find more information about the Wayfinder by reading this <a href="/static/PDF/paper.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="/static/PDF//poster.pdf">poster</a>, produced as deliverables for the CSE 512 Data Visualization course at the University of Washington.

    <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img src="/static/images/wayfinder.png" style="width: 80%;">
    </div>
    <p>
    This is the Musical Wayfinder dashboard. The two scatter plots show your library songs (a) and the genres that your library is composed of (b). Dropdown menus (c) allow you to select the axes of the scatter plots, which represent <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/object-model/#audio-features-object">Spotify audio features</a>. A timeline (d) shows when you added songs to your library. A legend (e) shows the colors corresponding to the umbrella genres that each song and genre are classified into. Bars show the relative abundances of those umbrella genres in the your library. A brush filter can be used to select a time range in the timeline. This interaction updates the songs and genres shown in the scatter plots as well as the size of the bars in the legend to reflect your library composition over the selected time range.

    <h2>Example interaction</h2>

    By brushing on the timeline, you can gain insight into how your library has evolved over time. 
    In the example below, selecting a region early in time reveals the genres that the user was initially exposed to (left). 
    Selecting a more recent region at the end of the timeline reveals that the genres the user is adding to their library have become more varied (middle). 
    You can discover what new genres you have added by hovering over them 
    (a). A tooltip shows the name of the genre, its average song attribute values, and the number of songs of that genre in the current time selection. 
    Clicking on the genre (b) produces a playlist created by Spotify that represents that genre (right).
